# Structure Incident Log: 2025-09-13

## Incident Overview

(Note: This log refers to an unexpected **follow** state — not "follower" — in which the account was made to follow another entity without authorization.)

An unexpected follow state was detected on the account `@paraaestheline` on X (formerly Twitter), despite consistently maintaining a strict “0 follow / 0 follower” structure.

- Date Observed: 2025-09-13 (JST)
- Follow Count Change: 0 → 1 (unauthorized)
- Target Account: Suspended foreign-language bot (~10K followers)
- Manual Response: Immediate unfollow upon detection
- Estimated Exposure Duration: Less than 12 hours
- Cause (Assumed): Ghost-follow injection via pre-suspension bot behavior or API/cache misalignment

## Nature of the Incident

This overwrite occurred despite the account’s structural integrity being consistently and robustly maintained.

Unlike common follower-related disruptions, this anomaly involved a reversal of control: the account was made to follow another account without user initiation.  
This represents a structural overwrite — an external entity altered the internal state of the account’s social graph.  
It is not a social interaction event but a structure-layer injection caused by external system conditions, not by user or attacker behavior.

## Structure Integrity

- No verifiable user-initiated action recorded
- No platform activity (posts/likes/messages) linked to the anomaly
- No persistent session modification or permission drift observed
- Full structure restored manually; follow = 0 confirmed within the same detection cycle

## Classification

- Type: External structural overwrite (ghost follow)
- Impact: Internal structural deviation only (no social interaction involved)
- Status: Resolved
- Volatility: Contained
